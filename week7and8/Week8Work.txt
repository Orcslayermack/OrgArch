#Below is the code to setup and array of 10 integers in MIPS, #stored contiguously with the address of a[0] in register $t2, 
#and registers $t0 and $t1 initialized to 0.  Write MIPS code to find the sum of the even values. Your code should assemble and run in MARS.  
#I will monitor check this assignment; it must be completed by start of class on Friday.
